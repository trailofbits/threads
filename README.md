# THREADS

THREADS was an annual conference that focused on pragmatic security research and new discoveries in network attack and defense. Held each year during NYU-Polyâ€™s Cyber Security Awareness Week (CSAW) in Brooklyn, NY, THREADS was organized by NYU-Poly Hacker in Residence Dan Guido.

THREADS aimed to present and discuss cutting edge, peer-reviewed, industrial and academic research in computer and network security. THREADS focused on developments and advances in attack techniques and attacker methodologies. We aimed to discuss what vulnerabilities exist and how attackers of today and tomorrow exploit those vulnerabilities.
